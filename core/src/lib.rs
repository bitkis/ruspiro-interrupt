//! # Interrupt Core functions
//!
//! Core functions to enable/disable interrupts globally. This is splitted from the
//! [``ruspiro-interrupt``](https://crates.io/crates/ruspiro-interrupt) crate to remove circular dependencies between
//! the interrupt crate and others (e.g. ``ruspiro-singleton``).

// this is usually set and cleared by the interrupt handler [interrupt_handler]

//       a different state this is not reflected at the moment. For the time beeing it is assumed
